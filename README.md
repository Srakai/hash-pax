## ðŸš€ Hash Pax
Hash Pax â€” the Pax controller you didnâ€™t know you needed. While the Pax app ghosted the App Store, weâ€™ve stepped in with over-engineered Bluetooth magic. Control your vaporizer like a pro, straight from the terminal. Who needs an app when youâ€™ve got Python?

### ðŸ”¥ Features
Lock/Unlock: Because privacy matters, even with vapes.
Temperature Control: Adjust to exactly the right level of chill.
Battery Check: Know when to recharge or rage quit.
Real-time Notifications: Because why not get play-by-play updates from your vape?
Pax App? ðŸ˜‚
Yeah, about that... Pax appâ€™s MIA on the App Store. We donâ€™t know, maybe itâ€™s off-grid. Meanwhile, Hash Pax is here to fill the void, with a CLI interface cooler than an app store reject.

### ðŸ™Œ Shout-out
Big props to Tristan Seifert for reverse-engineering the Pax protocol. Without him, this would just be a vaporous idea.

### ðŸš€ Quick Start
Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```
Run the CLI like a boss:
```bash
python main.py probe
```
